Our first assignment 1 has three parts:

(1) Reproduce the Bias-Variance plot in Page 23 (attach codes and the plot) using the example: y=sin(x)+cos(x)+e;

(2) Given an explanation for why the third function class is better than the last function class for the example on Pages 14-20 Tuesday Slides (Week 1)

(3) Reproduce the result in Page 19 of KNN in Thursday Slides on Thursday, Week 1 (testing performance decreases and then increases.) (Codes and results should be included in the PDF)
